\begin{exercise}\label{ex:mva_numerical}
  Consider two stations in tandem, stations 0 and 1. The service times
  are $\E{ S_0} = 2=1/\mu_0$ and $\E{ S_1} = 3=1/\mu_1$ hours. The routing matrix is
  \begin{equation*}
    P=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & 1\\
1/2 & 1/2\\
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
Apply the MVA algorithm to this case.
\begin{hint}
Start with $n=1$, then consider $n=2$ and so on.
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
  From $V P = V$ we conclude that $V_1=2V_0$.  Take $n=1$.
  \begin{align*}
\E{ W_0(1)} &= \E{ L_0(0)+1}\E{ S_0} = \E{ S_0 }= 2,\\
 \E{ W_1(1)} &= \E{ L_1(0)+1}\E{ S_1} = \E{ S_1} = 3,\\
 \E{ W(1)} &= \sum_{i=0}^1 V_i \E{ W_i(1)} = V_0 2 + V_1  3 = 1\cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 = 8,\\
 \TH_0(1) &= \frac{1}{\E{ W(1)}} = \frac18, \\
 \E{ L_0(1)} &= \TH_0(1) \E{ W_0(1)} = \frac28=\frac14, \\
 \E{ L_1(1)} &= \TH_1(1) \E{ W_1(1)} = V_1 \TH_0(1) \E{ W_1(1)}= 2 \cdot \frac18 \cdot 3 = \frac34.\\
  \end{align*}
Now take $n=2$.     
  \begin{align*}
\E{ W_0(2) }&= (\E{ L_0(1)+1}\E{ S_0}= (1/4+1)\E{ S_0} = \frac54\cdot2=\frac52,\\
\E{ W_1(2) }&= (\E{ L_1(1)+1}\E{ S_1} = (3/4+1)\E{ S_1} = \frac74\cdot3=\frac{21}4,\\
\E{ W(2) }&= \sum_{i=0}^1 V_i \E{ W_i(2)} = \frac52 + 2 \cdot \frac{21}4=13,\\
\TH_0(2) &= \frac{2}{\E{ W(2)}} = \frac2{13}, \\
\TH_1(2) &= V_1 \TH_0(2) = \frac4{13}, \\
\E{ L_0(2)} &= \TH_0(2) \E{ W_0(2)} = \frac2{13}\cdot \frac52=\frac5{13}, \\
\E{ L_1(2)} &= \TH_1(2) \E{ W_1(2)} = \frac{4}{13} \cdot \frac{21}{4} = \frac{21}{13}.\\
  \end{align*}
And so on.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Zijm.Ex.3.1.13. Assume that all stations have just one server.
\begin{solution}
  Since there are quite a lot of jobs, and station 0 is the
  bottleneck, i.e., the station with the highest load, most of the
  time there will be a queue at station 0. In fact, most of the jobs
  will be in queue in front of station 0. Therefore the rate out of
  station 0 will be approximately equal to its service rate, i.e.,
  $\mu_0$. Thus, station 1 will receive jobs at a rate
  $\lambda_1\approx\mu_0$, i.e., $\lambda_1 \approx 2$. Now I simply
  approximate the queueing process at station 1 as an $M/M/1$ queue
  with $\mu_1=2.5$. Hence, $\rho_1 = \lambda_1/\mu_1=2/2.5 = 4/5$,
  hence $L_1 = \rho_1/(1-\rho_1) = (4/5)/(1/5) = 4$.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
Zijm.Ex.3.1.14
\begin{solution}
  I use the MVA algorithm to compute the expected number of jobs at
  each of the stations. Again, as in an earlier question in which I
  implemented the convolution algorithm, nearly as a one-liner,
  studying the code in detail is very rewarding. I include the
  numerical results at the end.


 Start with computing the visit ratios.

\begin{pyconsole}
from functools import lru_cache
import numpy as np
from numpy.linalg import eig

mu = np.array([2, 2.5, 3, 3, 3])
c = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])  # single-server stations
P = np.matrix([
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]
)

v, w = eig(P.T)
x = v.real.argmax()
V = w[:, x].real
V = V / V[0]
print(V)
  
\end{pyconsole}
The visit ratios are according to expectation.


The following implements the MVA algorithm. Note how easy the code becomes with
memoization; I only have to specify the recursions and the `boundary
conditions', i.e., what to do when $n=0$. For the rest I don't have to
think about in what exact sequence each of the functions needs to be
called. The memoization takes care of all these problems.

\begin{pyconsole}
@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def EL(j, n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return TH(j, n) * EW(j, n)


@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def EW(j, n):
    return (EL(j, n - 1) + 1) / mu[j]


@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def TH(j, n):
    if j == 0:
        return n / sum(V[j] * EW(j, n) for j in range(len(mu)))
    else:
        return V[j] * TH(0, n)
  
\end{pyconsole}
This is all!


Now I print the expected jobs at the stations. 

\begin{pyconsole}
print("  n   EL0   EL1   EL2  EL3   EL4   TH0")
for n in range(1,30):
    res = "{:3d}".format(n)
    for j in range(len(mu)):
        res += "{:6.2f}".format(float(EL(j, n)))
    res += "{:6.2f}".format(float(TH(0,n)))
    print(res)
  
\end{pyconsole}

This is interesting. Using the insights of the previous question,
approximation stations 3, 4 and 5 as $M/M/1$ queues, we have according
to this model that $\E{ L_3} = \rho_3/(1-\rho_3)$. Taking
$\lambda_3 = 2$ and $\mu_3 = 3$, we see that $\rho_3 = 2/3$ so that
$\E{ L_3} = 2$.  This is very close to $1.98$. 

For the last line, with $n=29$, the number of jobs at station 0 must
therefore be approximately $29-4-2-2-2 = 19$. The algorithm supports
our intuition!
\end{solution}

  make Figure 3.2.
